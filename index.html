      The grid is the backbone of modern civilisation, yet it was built for predictability.
      Renewables made it clean, but unstable. To decarbonise completely, stability must return.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Bubble</strong> is high-temperature compressed-air energy storage.
      It stores energy as pressurised air and heat, at 200 bar and over 1000 °C, using only air, steel, and rock.
      No lithium. No degradation. No fire risk. Engineered for fifty years, not five.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is simple: firm the renewable grid.
    </p>

      Bubble is advancing toward TRL-6 demonstration in the Netherlands.
      We are seeking aligned partners who share a long-term view of the energy transition.
