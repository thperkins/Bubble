    <p><strong>What gets firmer as it becomes more flexible?</strong></p>

    <p>
      Imagine an energy system that can yield without failing - elastic, connected, giving way in one place to strengthen another.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is the architecture we’re building: a <strong>ductile energy system.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      When generation can flex, more sources find space.<br>
      Power flows where it’s needed, not where it’s trapped.<br>
      Congestion eases, capture rates rise, and abundance becomes usable.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Bubble</strong> gives form to that idea: high-temperature compressed-air storage built from durable, elemental materials.<br>
      Air, steel, stone - lasting not for cycles, but enduring for decades.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Bubble, we believe progress is born from purposeful engineering - focusing on leveraged interventions where intelligent interventions ripple outward to amplify impact.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is to catalyse transformation: to turn flexibility into strength, abundance into reliability, and the energy transition into permanence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If that vision moves you, join us.
