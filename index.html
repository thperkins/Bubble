    <h1>Bubble</h1>

    <p>
      The grid is the backbone of modern civilisation, yet it was built for predictability.
      Renewables made it clean, but unstable. To decarbonise completely, stability must return—
      without going back to combustion or depletion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bubble is high-temperature compressed-air energy storage. It stores energy as pressurised air and heat,
      at 200 bar and over 1000 °C, using only air, steel, and rock.
      No lithium. No degradation. No fire risk. Designed for fifty years, not five.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe energy storage should be infrastructure—measured in decades,
      built from abundant materials, and operated with thermodynamic honesty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is simple: permanence for a renewable grid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bubble is advancing toward TRL-6 demonstration with TNO in the Netherlands.
      We are seeking aligned partners who share a long-term view of the energy transition.
